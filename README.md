Bricks for working with flutter_modular

## Installation

To use the bricks in your project, init you project using `mason init`. Then add the bricks to your project by pasting the following code in your `mason.yaml` file:

```yaml
bricks:
  module:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/mcquenji/flutter_modular_bricks.git
      path: module
```

After adding the bricks to your `mason.yaml` file, run `mason get` to download the bricks into your project.
